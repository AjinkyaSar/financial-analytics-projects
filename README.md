## 📂 Current Projects  

### 1. Loan Default Prediction – Classification Model  
- Predicted borrower defaults using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.  
- Applied SMOTE to balance imbalanced data, validated using cross-validation and ROC-AUC.  
- Built an interactive widget to simulate default prediction scenarios.  

### 2. Financial Health Score – Regression Modeling  
- Built a Multiple Linear Regression model on company financial data.  
- Used VIF and backward elimination to retain only significant predictors.  
- Developed a scoring equation to evaluate financial health across industries.  

### 3. Fraud Detection – Financial Institutions Dataset  
- Applied Logistic Regression with cross-validation to detect fraudulent transactions.  
- Used SMOTE for balancing, Isolation Forest for anomaly detection, and SHAP for feature refinement.  
- Achieved 82% validated accuracy after variable selection.  

### 4. Stock Market Analysis – ARIMA Forecasting  
- Built ARIMA models to forecast stock prices over a 5-day horizon.  
- Applied stationarity tests, ACF/PACF plots, and parameter optimization.  
- Final ARIMA(0,1,1) model delivered the best forecast results.
